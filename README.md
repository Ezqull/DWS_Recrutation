# MOK YOK  IT - Recruitment

This is a repository, created to store finished exercises, in the process of recruitment for the position of Junior Data Warehouse Specialist. Each task is stored in different branch.

## Branches

There are 5 different branches:
- `main` - contains basic information about repository;
- `task1` - Contains whole Java / Maven project for task number 1;
- `task2` - Contains single SQL script for task number 2;
- `task3` - As in the task above, this branch contains single SQL script for task number 3;
- `task4` - This branch contains Talend project in a zip file (the size of the project was too big to store the whole of it)

To move between branches you can use command: `git checkout <branch_name>`, for example `git checkout task1`
